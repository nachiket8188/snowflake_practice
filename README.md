# snowflake_practice
This repo will contain code for different worksheets within Snowflake workspace. I intend to re-use this code with Github's help as I switch between trial accounts every few months. That is the purpose of this repo - to save me the hassle of maintaining these frequently run SQL scripts by myself.
